# 创建项目 hugo new &amp;lt;your GitHub username&amp;gt;.github.io # 安装主题 git clone --depth 1 --recursive https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes.git themes # 本地运行 hugo server -D Step 3:将HUGO项目推送至GitHub仓库 # 初始化仓库 git init # 将全部文件添加到暂存区 git add * # 提交暂存区代码 git commit -m &amp;#34;创建HUGO项目&amp;#34; # 创建主分支 git branch -M main # 配置远程Github仓库 git remote add origin https://github.com/&amp;lt;your GitHub username&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;your GitHub username&amp;gt;.</description></item><item><title>Chapter VI: Esmeralda</title><link>https://yulongbb.github.io/post/chapter-6/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2017 11:25:05 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yulongbb.github.io/post/chapter-6/</guid><description>We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public.</description></item><item><title>Chapter V: Quasimodo</title><link>https://yulongbb.github.io/post/chapter-5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:15:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yulongbb.github.io/post/chapter-5/</guid><description>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole’s idea. Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.</description></item><item><title>Chapter IV: Master Jacques Coppenole</title><link>https://yulongbb.github.io/post/chapter-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2017 11:14:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yulongbb.github.io/post/chapter-4/</guid><description>While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him.</description></item><item><title>Chapter III: Monsieur the Cardinal</title><link>https://yulongbb.github.io/post/chapter-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2017 11:13:32 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yulongbb.github.io/post/chapter-3/</guid><description>Poor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean, the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that famous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of Paris, on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven Burgundians at one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the Temple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic moment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, “His eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.</description></item><item><title>Chapter II: Pierre Gringoire</title><link>https://yulongbb.github.io/post/chapter-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2017 11:00:59 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yulongbb.github.io/post/chapter-2/</guid><description>Nevertheless, as be harangued them, the satisfaction and admiration unanimously excited by his costume were dissipated by his words; and when he reached that untoward conclusion: “As soon as his illustrious eminence, the cardinal, arrives, we will begin,” his voice was drowned in a thunder of hooting.
